<h1 align="center">Some examples of deforestation around the world</h1>
<div class="text">
    <p>And this is known as deforestation. Comparing data for the last 20 years we can see how much forests have been destroyed.
        Also in the amazon rain forests (which contain half the world's total rain forests), deforestation has led to devastating outcomes.
        In India the monsoons are affected adversely. The main reason being large scale deforestation.

    <center><h2>So what will happen if we don't stop this <em>madness?</em></h2></center>
    <p><b>Climate Change:</b> This is one of the biggest issues and deforestation is the biggest factor contributing to it. It's affecting the global carbon cycle.
        This global warming is in turning affecting all living beings! </p>
    <p><b>Soil Erosion:</b> This is second biggest issue which is concerning the environmentalists. This is a major problem as without trees the soil cannot hold its essential nutrients
        which is why it loses its value.
    </p>
    <p><b>Water Cycle:</b> This is also being affected by deforestation as trees play a major role in the water cycle.</p>
